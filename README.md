## 🧠 About Me

As a final-year student majoring in Software Engineering, I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My core tech stack includes **ASP.NET (C#)** and **React/Next.js**. I love building clean, responsive, and real-world web applications.

I'm currently looking for a **long-term fresher opportunity** to grow in a professional environment, contribute to real projects, and become a valuable part of the development team.
